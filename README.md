# 🧠 ML Learning Journey

This repository contains practical notebooks and learnings from three graduate-level courses:

- **Machine Learning**
- **Computer Vision & Deep Learning (CVDL)**
- **Natural Language Comprehension (NLC)**

Each course is organized in its own folder, with weekly labs, assignments, and experiments using Python, Jupyter, and popular ML/DL libraries like scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `ml/` – Regression, classification, SVMs, decision trees, etc.
- `cvdl/` – CNNs, ResNets, transfer learning, object detection, etc.
- `nlc/` – Text preprocessing, RNNs, Transformers, etc.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-learning.git
2. Open notebooks in Jupyter or Google Colab.

3. Explore by course and topic.

This repo is a personal log of my learning and experimentation in ML. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
